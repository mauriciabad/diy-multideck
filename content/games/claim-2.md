## Cards selection and drawing

To play Claim 2 you need 25 cards and 0 drawings.

You can add the [Claim 1](/games/claim) cards and play with both games. In case you want to use a faction that has the same color in both games, switch the color for an unused one. Or if you dont waht to switch colors, use the extra suits with black border, preferably on the Claim 2 cards, because there's less of them.
