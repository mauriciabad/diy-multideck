## Cards selection and drawing

To play Cheating Moth you need 68 cards (plus 1 card backs as guard) and 0 drawings (or 20 to avoid memorizing suit actions).

### Instructions

## Usage

- The value of the moths is, the card number (top-right), and if it's greater than 5, substract 5. So: `0 => 5` `1 => 1` `2 => 2` `3 => 3` `4 => 4` `5 => 5` `1 => 1` `2 => 2` `3 => 3`
