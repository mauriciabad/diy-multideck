## Inspiration

My main inspiration was The Everdeck, and the amazing forum thread in bgg that was used to get feedback and updates about the project. *I wish I've done the same, but I wanted to have something solid before showing it up to the world (And walla!, here it is!).*

What inspired me so much about The Ever deck was it's card distribution and mathematical approach to make everything fit evenly. The only thing that didn't convince me about The Everdeck was it's aim to have a "mystic" theme/utility. It's totally fine and awesome, but it didn't fulfill my specific need, that is: "play as many modern games as possible with a small deck".

My other motivation for this project, was that I was planning a sabbatical year bagpacking through the world, and I wanted to keep playing many board games, without having to carry them. So I did it as quick as possible, do I could have a printed beta version to take to the adventure, and when I come back from the trip, make some changes and release it to the public.
