- The card's size is **2.5 by 3.5 inches**, the same as standard poker cards. You can fit 9 cards in a DIN A4 sheet, and 18 cards in a DIN A3 sheet.
- They are meant to be printed in **100% plastic** sheets of  **300 g/m²** or more, so they are waterproof and extremely durable.
  - You could also use thick paper and/or laminate it, but they'd last less time, probably wouldn't shuffle satisfyingly, and possibly you couldn't either use pencils to draw on them.
- Drawing in the cards:
  - Pens/markers ink sticks into it and it cannot be erased, even the special whiteboard markers.
  - **Pencils** work as usual, making them the **best option** to write and erase.
- For now, the **print-n-play** pdf document is **not public**.
  - But, you can [**buy** the DIY Multideck](/buy) online in the official website to get a copy.
- The cards can be printed in a regular copy shop or at home.
- It's very important to ensure all cards have the **same size** (for shuffling).
  - The best way is by using an industrial guillotine, to cut all cards at once.
  - This is more important than the cards dimension, so don't worry if they don't measure exactly 2.5 x 3.5 inches.
- Try to have the maximum **precision** in matching the **front and back**.
  - If you're at home, make sure the paper tray is well aligned before printing and that you flip the paper correctly when printing the other side.
  - If you go to a shop, ask them to pay special attention to this and use a precise printer.
- To round the **corners**, it's best buy a small tool to do so, and do it yourself **manually**. Many copy shops won't do it or may charge a lot.
  - In Barcelona, Spain at Feb 2023, I managed to print a single deck for 26.2 € in a copy shop with great results. With 100% plastic (the most expensive sheet they sold) and without rounded corners.
