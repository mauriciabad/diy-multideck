To play any game with the Spanish suited deck you need 50 cards and 0 drawings.

### Instructions

![cards mapping](/images/mappings/spanish-deck.png)

1. Select 4 suits.
   {% callout type="idea" %}
   Ideally the poker ones: Hearts, Diamonds, Aces and Spides
   {% /callout %}
1. Pick the ranks `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `X` `J` `Q` from every chosen suit.
1. Pick the rank `0` from 2 suits, this will be the jokers.
   {% callout type="idea" %}
   You could also use the 0 as 10 and X as joker.
   {% /callout %}

## Usage

- The `X` card represents the `10` card.
- The `J` card represents the `11` card.
- The `Q` card represents the `12` card.
- The `0` card represents the joker card.
- The cards with letters (`J` `Q` `X`) are upside down. If the card is in the wrong rotation, the top-left suit will have a black border, indicating that it's in the wrong orientation.
