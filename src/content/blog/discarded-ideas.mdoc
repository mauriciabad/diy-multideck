This are some main ideas I was trying to bring to the deck, but I had to give up on them for various reasons.

For all of them, I found a way to fix the issues, and it was letting the players draw the game-specific elements in the cards not being used as numbered cards. Yes, it feels bad to write on cards, but they are meant for that, and the space would be used anyway with another less convenient thing.

- Words
  - What is it about? Adding 1 or many words to the cards to use as social games like Werewolf, Mafia, Avalon... Or for some other word games, like Cross clues.
  - Why discarded?
    - Because it would force players to only play the games I chose, I prefer you write the specific words you need for the games you like.
    - Also, with many words it would be confusing to know what is the word in use.
- Emojis in the cards
  - What is it about? Adding 1 or many emojis to the cards. To use as roles for social games, actions in specific games or any creative use players may come up with.
  - Why discarded?
    - Because it's actually the same as words, but more ambiguous. Could be good for multiple game re-using and using less space, but it could also could cause confusion up to a point of making games unplayable. For example: a player sees ðŸ§ª in her card, she thinks she has the doctor, but she's actually the witch and the doctor was: ðŸ’Š.
    - A part from that, the uses of emojis where not clear and, yes they look cool, but most of them wouldn't be used and confuse noob players.
- Index
  - What is it about? On the side of the cards, leave some light marks to let the owner of the deck draw a small line in the card edge, to indicate what cards belong to what games. And then, to setup a game he would just have to slightly displace the cards and pick the ones with the mark on the same position.
  - Why discarded?
    - Because it requires high precision in printing and cutting, and it's unrealistic to do at home.
    - Also, the marks where so small and close, that it was too easy to pick other game's cards by mistake. Also, added clutter.
- Generic action icons
  - What is it about? On the top-right corner, put a generic icon of something related to card games, like a crossed card or a shield, to be used to play games that have special cards, like the UNO.
  - Why discarded?
    - Because games use very specific icons, and is very difficult to make a set of icons that work in many games.
    - Also, the killer factor is that, I realized that, when playing a game with regular suits and special cards, it's very easy to get confused and think that an icon card is meant to be used as a number card and vice-versa, specially in games with more than 4 suits. This makes the game unplayable.
    - And another reason was that if the action icon you need, is in a card that you need for the numbered cards, you're in trouble, because you'll have to chose another less-ideal icon and players will confuse the original card as the action card and the less-ideal with the number card, messing everything up.
