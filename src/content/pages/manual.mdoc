## Introduction

The DIY multideck is a deck of 162 playing cards (3 standard decks) that lets you play hundreds of existing games, not only classic card games, but also modern games that use components like boards or coins. The DIY multideck is **ideal for travelling** and **prototyping new games**. The cards are waterproof and very resistant, ready to join you on your next trip!

This is how it works: when you play a game, you pick a subset of cards and focus on a specific corner. Sometimes you may draw on the cards to play games that use words, icons or boards. In the [official website](/), you'll find instructions to play many games. Here you have some example games for every game system supported:

{% cardAnatomyImg /%}

### Basic suit

{% basicSuitImg /%}

On the top left and bottom right corners, there's a number overlapping an emoji (suit), it is the "Basic suit".

It is the most used game system of the deck, and thus, the most easy to use. When mapping new games, always give priority to it.

It contains 8 suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}) of 15 ranks (0...9 + XJQKA), named _15-ranked suits_, and 4 suits ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}) of 10 ranks (0...9), named _10-ranked suits_. They can be combined into several distributions.

#### Ranks

- 0...9: _Numeric ranks_ (0123456789).
  - 0 can be used as Joker or wildards.
  - 0 can be used as 10 in some games.
  - 1 can be used as an Ase.
- XJQKA: _Letter ranks_.
  - They are: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ase.
  - Can be used as 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

The other corners' numbers always end with this suit's number. Except when the rank is XJQKA, then the corners end with 01234 or 56789, respectivelly. For example, when the rank A, the other corners end in 1 or 6.

#### Suits

The suits can be classified into 2 categories by the amount of ranks they contain. So there are the 15-ranked suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}) or 10-ranked suits ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}).

{% suitsTable /%}

Each suit has a fixed [coin flip](#coin-flip) value. For example, {% suit id=0 /%} is always {% coinFlip id="no" /%}.

Each suit has a number id, it can be found on the _black part_ of the [Sequential number](#sequential-number).

#### 12 suits of 10 ranks

One combination is 12 suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}{% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}) of 10 rank (0...9).

There will be some unused cards, that may be optionally used to add extra ranks to some suits. The remaining cards are: the 5 _letter ranks_ (XJQKA) of the 15-ranked suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}).

To get it pick all the cards, and remove the _letter ranks_ (XJQKA).

Switch the suits for the ranks to have 10 suits (0...9) of 12 ranks ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}{% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}). Only use this if you need 9 or 10 suits of 11 or 12 ranks.

#### 8 suits of 15 ranks

Another combination is 8 suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}) of 15 ranks (0...9 + XJQKA).

There will be some unused cards, that may be optionally used to add extra suits. The remaining cards are: all the ranks (0...9) of the 10-ranked suits ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}).

To get it pick all the cards, and remove the 10-ranked suits ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}).

Switch the suits for the ranks to have 15 suits (0...9 + XJQKA) of 8 ranks ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}). Only use this if you need 13 to 15 suits of 8 or less ranks.

#### 10-level pyramidal deck with same ranks

You can also make an pyramidal deck of 10 levels, where each suit has the same rank. To do it, pick one 1, two 2's, three 3s... Up to ten 0's (0 would count as 10), no matter the suit you pick.

<!-- TODO: Add Chosŏn to the game list -->
<!-- An example game that uses it is [Chosŏn](/games/chosn). -->

#### 12-level pyramidal deck with different ranks

You can also make an pyramidal deck of 12 levels, where each suit has different ranks. To do it, for every suit pick a different amount of cards: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, 12. Make sure that the suits that are repeated 12 and 11 times are the 15-ranked suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}). Each level uses a different suit, and there's no rank indicating how many cards does that level have.

An example game that uses it is [Startups](/games/startups).

### 3D suit

{% 3dSuitImg /%}

On the top-right or bottom-left corner you can find a number overlapping a shape with two small numbers on the bottom sides, it is the "3D suit". It is called 3D because it is a multidimensional game system of 3 dimensions: shape, rank, and color.

Colors: {% colorSuit id=1 /%}{% colorSuit id=2 /%}{% colorSuit id=3 /%}{% colorSuit id=4 /%}{% colorSuit id=5 /%}{% colorSuit id=6 /%}

#### 5 suits of 3 times 10 ranks

TODO: Fill this section

#### 3 suits of 5 times 10 ranks

TODO: Fill this section

### Sequential number

{% sequentialNumberImg /%}

On the top-right or bottom-left corner you can find a number that's not on top of a suit, it is the "Sequential number".

It contains numbers **from 0 to 159**.

Because **each card has a different number**, it is used to reference the cards.

The number has two colors:

- The **black part** indicates the **number of the suit**.  When the _sequential number_ is greater than 120 it no longer indicates the suit number.
  - For example the card 117 has the suit {% suit id=11 /%}, and is the suit number 11 because the black part of the number is 11.
- The **colored part** **matches the color** of the basic suit of that card. It also **matches the rank** of the _basic suit_, and the _3D suit_ (except when the rank is a letter (XJQKA)).

#### Numbers from 0 to 159

Just use the _Sequential number_ as is.

It is used in games that need many unsuited ranks. Games that use it are [The mind](/games/the-mind) and [No thanks!](/games/no-thanks).

#### Numbers from 0 to 59, 2 times

You can also have 2 times numbers from 0 to 59, plus 1 time numbers from 60 to 99, by ignoring the hundreds digit. So, for example, 120 would become 20, and 20 would stay as 20.

#### Numbers from -59 to 100

Similarly, you can also have negative numbers if you treat numbers greater than 100 negative (or positive), to make a distribution of -59...100 (or -100...59).

#### 15 ordered suits of 10 ranks (or vice versa)

You can also make a distribution of 15 ordered suits of 10 ranks (or vice versa) by making the _black part_ the suit, and the _colored part_ the rank.

But it is quite unintuitive to use, so only use this combination if you need ordered suits, or 13 to 15 suits of 9...10 ranks, otherwise it's better to use the ["switched" basic suit](#basic-suit).

### Pyramidal rank

{% pyramidalRankImg /%}

Under the [sequential number](#sequential-number), there's a small number indicating the "Pyramidal rank".

- On the 8 _15-ranked suits_ ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}), each suit has: five 1's, four 2's, three 3's, two 4's, and one 5.
- On the 4 _10-ranked suits_ ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}), each suit has: four 1's, three 2's, two 3's, and one 4.

The _pyramidal rank_ has the color of the [basic suit](#basic-suit) in that card.

The _pyramidal rank_ can be used as an alternative rank for games that require an uneven number of specific ranks, like [Hanabi](/games/hanabi).

#### 8 times: five 1s, four 2s, three 3s, two 4s, one 5

Use the _Pyramidal rank_ of the _15-ranked suits_.

There will be left over cards that may be used if the game needs more suits. The unused cards are 4 times: four 1's, three 2's, two 3's, and one 4.

#### 12 times: four 1s, three 2s, two 3s, one 4

Use the _Pyramidal rank_ of the _10-ranked suits_ and _15-ranked suits_, but excluding the 5s.

#### Other pyramidal decks

You can also make pyramidal decks of 10-12 levels without using the _Pyramidal ranks_. Learn how in the [Basic suit section](#basic-suit).

### Coin flip

{% coinFlipImg /%}

Under the sequential number, there's an icon representing "yes" ({% coinFlip id="yes" /%}), "no" ({% coinFlip id="no" /%}) or "unknown" ({% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}). There are 60 {% coinFlip id="yes" /%}, 60 {% coinFlip id="no" /%} and 40 {% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}.

- The 4 first even suits ({% suit id=0 /%}{% suit id=2 /%}{% suit id=4 /%}{% suit id=6 /%}) have a {% coinFlip id="no" /%}.
- The 4 first odd suits ({% suit id=1 /%}{% suit id=3 /%}{% suit id=5 /%}{% suit id=7 /%}) have a {% coinFlip id="yes" /%}.
- The 4 10-ranked suits ({% suit id=8 /%}{% suit id=9 /%}{% suit id=10 /%}{% suit id=11 /%}), have a {% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}.

The coin flip icon has the color of the basic suit in that card.

#### Use cases

It comes in handy when players need to emit a vote and reveal them all at the same time. This voting mechanism can be fond in [The Resistance: Avalon](/games/the-resistance-avalon) and [Secret Hitler](/games/secret-hitler).

Another usage is when there are many copies of 2 to 3 kind of cards. The game [Skulls and Roses](/games/skull) uses this feature where {% coinFlip id="no" /%} are skulls and {% coinFlip id="yes" /%} roses.

### Drawing

Even tough it may seem that by drawing you'll destroy your cards, make them ugly or waste them, the truth is the opposite: **if you don't draw on them, you're wasting the cards**, because they are meant for that. The DIY Multideck provides a solid base to play many games and, additionally, draw in the cards to support more games. Drawing on the cards also make games easier to play, because the drawings can resemble the original game card's.

Rather than filling the cards with predetermined games, I want to encourage you to personalize them by adding the games you enjoy playing. This is why it's called "The DIY Multideck".

{% callout type="info" %}
**Use a pencil** to draw, so you can erase or tweak the drawing if needed. Pens, markers, and other things also work, but I don't recommend using them because making changes is very common.

Anyways, although you can erase the drawings, I generally don't recommend doing it. If you keep the drawings, you won't have to spend time again to prepare that game. It is generally not anoying to play with drawings from other games.
{% /callout %}

When adding new drawings:

- Consider duplicating the drawing on the opposite side slots to make the card playable in any rotation.
- Place them strategically to leave the most usable spots to your favorite games.
- Try to come up with generic drawings that may be used in other games, so you save up space.

In some cases generic drawings can be counter-productive, so be mindfull. For example, consider two unrelated games (A and B) using a similar drawing. On game A, there's a card with a drawing. That same card is also used in game B. But game B is not suposed to have a drawing on that card. So a player can mistakenly think that that card in game B is something special, when it is not.

{% drawingImg /%}

Each card has 14 drawing drawing slots, grouped in 5 drawing areas.

#### {% drawingAreaIcon id="A" /%} Drawing area A

2 rectangular slots on the top and bottom edges.

- The card needs to be hold in hand and contain a big drawing or word.
- The card needs to be stacked on the table while keeping the top or bottom part visible.

#### {% drawingAreaIcon id="B" /%} Drawing area B

4 square slots just below every suit.

- The card needs to be hold in hand.
- The drawing is related to the suit.

#### {% drawingAreaIcon id="C" /%} Drawing area C

6 square slots between the _Drawing areas B_, in groups of 3 columns.

- The card needs a hint, like punctuation.
- The card's hint doesn't need to be visible while holding it on hand, otherwise use the area A.

#### {% drawingAreaIcon id="D" /%} Drawing area D

4 rectangular slots on the center, forming a 2x2 grid.

- The card needs to be placed in the table.
- The card can be hold in hand, but it's the only one.
- The card needs to contain a big drawing or word.
- The card is not used actively during the gameplay, like hints or boards, and your notes cards are full.

#### {% drawingAreaIcon id="E" /%} Drawing area E

1 circular slot on the center, overlapping the _Drawing areas D_.

- You want to represent a tile, chip, token, or similar.
- The card needs to be placed in the table.

### Counting

The back side of the cards also has utility, they serve as counters.

{% callout type="idea" %}
**Optional**: You can add a title to the counter by writing it in the area A of a card and putting it below.

Don't overuse this technique or you'll run out of space, for example, if every player _only_ has to count coins, don't put titles on the counters, it's assumed they are coins.
{% /callout %}

#### Stacking method

{% stackingCounterImg /%}

Count **from 0 to 30** with **less than 10 cards**.

Stack cards upright (worth 1) or upside-down (worth 5), the sum is the result.

The example is counting 13, 3 times 1 plus 2 times 5.

- Cards han be holded in the hand.
- Convinient when coins are exchanged frequently by the players.
- Use when counter needs to be "private" (only known by the own player).

#### Pointing method

{% pointingCounterImg /%}

Count **from 0 to 10** with only **2 cards**.

Put 2 cards on top of each other, and align the arrow from the card in front to point a number in the card on the back, the pointed number is the result.

The example is counting 1, because the arrow is pointing at 1.

- Watch out to not move the cards by mistake or you'll lose the count.
- You can rotate the front card, and count negative or positive points.

It works well as point tracking boards, like the one in the game [Jekyll vs Hyde](/games/jekyll-vs-hyde).

#### Chained pointing method

{% chainedPointingCounterImg /%}

Count **any amount** with very **few cards**.

Create a pointing counter for every digit of the result number.

The example is counting 950, each of the counters is counting 9, 5, and 0, respectivelly, if you concatenate the digits you get the number 950. To create it follow this steps:

1. Take 6 cards (2 for each digit).
2. Create 3 counters side by side (using the [pointing method](#pointing-method)).
3. Move the first pointing card to 9, the second to 5, and the third to 0.
4. The first counter represents the hundreds, the second the tens, and the third the units.

You can also represent decimal numbers with this method, by defining a counter as the decimal point.

## Extra cards

When printing cards on a A3 sized paper, there's room for 18 cards per page. This deck uses 160 cards, leaving 2 blank spaces. This 2 spaces are used in the form of "extra cards", that don't have any suit or rank.

You can use the extra cards in games that need a card with a different background and no information on the front (you can also flip a normal card, but it can be confusing). For example in [The crew](/games/the-crew-1), the "reminder cards".

### Cover card

{% cardImgWithText src="/images/home/cards/card-cover.png" %}

Only 1 copy.

Contains:

- Name of the deck.
- Preview of all basic suits.
- QR code pointing to the website.

{% /cardImgWithText %}

### Notes cards

{% cardImgWithText src="/images/home/cards/card-notes.png" %}

3 copies (in 2 cards).

Use them to keep any useful information.

Some use cases are:

- Player aid.
- Simplified game board.
- Game setup (what cards, how many per player...).
- Definition/Diagram of specific rule or mechanic.
- List of games in the deck.

{% /cardImgWithText %}

## Card arrangements

When mapping new games, it's handy to visualize the cards in a layout that fits with the main sub-deck it uses.

The next images show simplified versions of the cards to focus better on the distribution. Notice that the 3 elements of the card get re-arranged based on the distribution, this way the element on the top is always the main one of that layout.

### Basic layout

{% img src="/images/home/layouts/mini-cards-basic.png" width="100%" alt="mini-cards-basic" /%}

### 3D layout

{% img src="/images/home/layouts/mini-cards-3d.png" width="67%" alt="mini-cards-3d" /%}

### Sequential layout

{% img src="/images/home/layouts/mini-cards-sequential.png" width="67%" alt="mini-cards-sequential" /%}

### Pyramidal layout

{% img src="/images/home/layouts/mini-cards-pyramidal.png" width="100%" alt="mini-cards-pyramidal" /%}

### Coin flip layout

{% img src="/images/home/layouts/mini-cards-coin.png" width="100%" alt="mini-cards-coin" /%}

## Mapping new games

You may want to play a game that is not on [the official supported games list](/games), so here you have some tips about how to do it.

### Step 1: Finding out the game's components

The first thing you have to figure out is the **components used** on the game, how they are used, and wich can be eliminated. To do so I recommend:

- Find the **official rulebook**, usually there's a section with the game's components.
  - To find it, google the game's name plus "rulebook" or "rules".
  - You can also go to the game's Goard Game Geek entry _Files_ section, usually you find the rules in a PDF.
  - If none of that works, try looking for the rulebook in other languages like german, spanish or french.
- Find **unofficial rulebooks** or other resources explaining the game, there are **websites** dedicated to this.
- Search for **images** of the game.
  - For example on Google Images, Goard Game Geek, or eCommerces selling the game.
- Watch **unboxings or how to play videos** of the game.
- Try to find a **print and play** version of the game.
- Find a fanmade **re-theme** of the game.
  - Usually they are on the game's Goard Game Geek entry _Files_ section.

### Step 2: Map the game

Next, you have to map every component of the game to a feature of The DIY Multideck.

{% callout type="idea" %}
My recommendation is that you go to the [Feature summary](#feature-summary) find out what's the best game system to use.
{% /callout %}

You can also quickly spot the main game system ([Basic](#basic-suit), [3D](#3d-suit), [Sequential](#sequential-number), [Pyramidal](#pyramidal-rank), or [Voting](#coin-flip)) by answering the following questions in order: (There are edge cases not covered)

1. Does it use coins, chips, tokens, progress boards, or similar things? → [Counting](#counting).
1. Does it just use 3 or less types of cards repeated many times? → [Coin flip](#coin-flip).
1. Does it need 1 or 2 cards with a different back face? → [Extra cards](#extra-cards)
1. Does it need icons, words, or extra info on the card (a.k.a. drawings)? → [Drawing](#drawing).
1. Does it have 8 or less suits of 15 or les ranks? → [Basic](#basic-suit).
1. Does it have 12 or less suits of 10 or les ranks? → [Basic](#basic-suit).
1. Does it just have numbers, and are they larger than 30?
    1. Are there numbers larger than 160? → _Not compatible_.
    1. Are there numbers repeated 2 or more times that are larger than 59? → _Not compatible_.
    1. Else → [Sequential number](#sequential-number).
1. Does each rank get repeated?
    1. Is it repeated 4 or more times? → _Not compatible_.
    1. Does it have 7 or more suits? → _Not compatible_.
    1. Else → [3D suit](#3d-suit).
1. Does it have 16 or more different ranks?.
    1. With 6 or more suits? → _Not compatible_.
    1. Else → [3D suit](#3d-suit).
1. Does it use a 3D deck of 5x3x10 or less? → [3D suit](#3d-suit).
1. Does each suit have an uneven distribution where there's just numbers form 1 to 5? → [Pyramidal rank](#pyramidal-rank).
1. Does it have more than 8 suits of more than 10 ranks each?
    1. Does it have more than 16 suits of more than 11 ranks (or vice versa)? → _Not compatible_
    1. Else → [Sequential number](#sequential-number).
1. Else → Probably "_Not compatible_" or "_Low usability_". Read the [deck's manual](/manual) deeper to find the right game system if it exists.

Now you just select the cards the game will need, it will probably be a subset of the game system chosen.

If the game has multiple components, you'll have to put more effort into trying to find a combination of cards that meets all the requirements. To do so, I recommend you pick the main game system used, and use the respective layout on the [Card arrangements](#card-arrangements) section as a visual aid to decide what cards to use for each component.

If the game needs drawings, read the [Drawing](#drawing) section.

### Step 3: Submit the mapping

Finally send us the mapping to [hello@mauriciabad.com](mailto:hello@mauriciabad.com), so we can add it to the website and make it easily accessible to you and other people.

## Other details

### Credits

The DIY multideck has been created on 2024 by [Maurici Abad](https://mauriciabad.com), a software engineer and bagpacker from Spain.

The deck was heavily inspired by [The Everdeck](https://thewrongtools.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/the-everdeck/). Read more on the [inspiration section](#inspiration).

### Design choices

The rank is inside the suit to save up space. The downside is that it requires players to spread more the cards in hand to see the rank, but it's not uncomfortable.

All suits are emojis, so you can easily write cheat sheets on your phone and send them to the other players.

The colors of the suits can be grouped by similar hue in pairs but also trios.

The slogan "Draw your cards" is there to encourage people to draw, and lose the fear of drawing in cards. It's fine! If you run out of space, you'll have amortized very well the cards, don't worry.

The first 10 numbers of the sequential number corner start with 0 to make mantain the visual pattern of color in the number (left side black, right side colored)

The check is filled and the cross hollow to increase the contrast between the two icons. And the question mark is also different by removing the enclosing circle.

The coin flip icon and pyramidal rank are in the sequential number's corner to concentrate all the printed parts in the corners, so the rest of the space is perfectly symetrical and drawings can be drawn twice, upright and upside-down, to make cards work both orientations.

Small digits in the 3D deck corner, start on 1 instead of on 0, for a more natural use of the cards, although then you cant just concatenate the digits to create numbers from 00 to 29.

Small digits in the 3D deck corner are there for color-blind people, so they can know the color of the suit. And the number on the other side is also there to let players identify quicker the 3 components of the suit. The numbers are there also to add an order to the suits that may be used in some games, although it's preatty rare.

The card backs use a lot of ink to increase the opacity of the card, specially on the corners, that's why the arrows are black.

Not all suits have the same amount of ranks. I decided to cut on some cards and make an overall uneven distribution, because it's rare to find games that use high ranks (+10) and many suits (+8) at the same time. There are very few of those games because the amount of cards would grow to more than 150 and it feels too many cards to handle for the player. Moreover, games with many cards usually have several kinds of cards with low ranks, so you need more suits without mattering much the amount of ranks.

All the numbers on the card corners match (on the units), if the rank is not letter (XJQKA).

### Inspiration

I got insipired from The Everdeck and Rainbow deck mainly. But I found interesting ideas on other multidecks.

### Printing

The cards are designed to be to printed at home or basic copy shop.

The material used is polyester 300 grams, almost all copy shops have it (at least in Spain) and it offers great resistance and it's waterproof. The only downsides are that it is not environmentaly friendly and that it is not fully opaque.

For now the pdf document to print the cards is not public, but if I see a lot of interest, I may reconsider it and licence them with a Creative Commons license.

### Legal note

_Is all of this legal?_ Yes, it is. Selling/buying or printing the DIY Multideck is legal, even if the porpoise is to play other games. Also, this website, with explanations of how to play other games, and all it's contents, is legal.

Board games are generally not protected intellectual property. What is usually protected with copyright, are the assets they use, like: cards, tokens, boards or rulebooks. Some game mechanics may be patented, but it's very rare.

Explaining how to play a board game is legal, as long as you don't use copyrighted material without permission to do so.

Regardless of all that, the original games will always be better than any adaptation done with the DIY Multideck, simply because the original games are made to just play a single game. But meanwhile you don't own the game, you can at least play an inferior version of it.
