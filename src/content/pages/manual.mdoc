## Introduction

The DIY multideck is a deck of 162 playing cards (3 standard decks) that lets you play hundreds of existing games, not only classic card games, but also modern games that use components like boards or coins. The DIY multideck is **ideal for travelling** and **prototyping new games**. The cards are waterproof and very resistant, ready to join you on your next trip!

This is how it works: when you play a game, you pick a subset of cards and focus on a specific corner. Sometimes you may draw on the cards to play games that use words, icons or boards. In the [official website](/), you'll find instructions to play many games. Here you have some example games for every game system supported:

- Basic deck: [Schotten Totten](/games/schotten-totten), [The Crew](/games/the-crew-1), [Cockroach Poker](/games/cockroach-poker-royal), [L.L.A.M.A.](/games/llama), [Claim](/games/claim)...

## Features In-Depth

### Drawing

Even tough it may seem that by drawing you'll destroy your cards, make them ugly or waste them, the truth is the opposite: **if you don't draw on them, you're wasting the cards**, because they are meant for that. The DIY Multideck provides a solid base to play many games and, additionally, draw in the cards to support more games. Drawing on the cards also make games easier to play, because the drawings can resemble the original game card's.

Rather than filling the cards with predetermined games, I want to encourage you to personalize them by adding the games you enjoy playing. This is why it's called "The DIY Multideck".

**Use a pencil** to draw, so you can erase or tweak the drawing if needed. Pens, markers, and other things also work, but I don't recommend using them because making changes is very common.

#### Drawing areas

{% cardImg src="/images/home/drawing-areas.png" /%}

As shown in the image, each card has 14 drawing drawing slots, grouped in 5 drawing areas.

In some games, you may need duplicate the drawing on the opposite side slots to make the card playable in any rotation.

##### Drawing area A

- The card needs to be hold in hand and contain a big drawing or word.
- The card needs to be stacked on the table while keeping the top or bottom part visible.

##### Drawing area B

- The card needs to be hold in hand.
- The drawing is related to the suit.

##### Drawing area C

- The card needs a hint, like punctuation.
- The card's hint doesn't need to be visible while holding it on hand, otherwise use the area A.

##### Drawing area D

- The card needs to be placed in the table.
- The card can be hold in hand, but it's the only one.
- The card needs to contain a big drawing or word.
- The card is not used actively during the gameplay, like hints or boards, and your notes cards are full.

##### Drawing area E

- You want to represent a tile, chip, token, or similar.
- The card needs to be placed in the table.

### Coin flip

{% coinFlipImg /%}

Under the sequential number, there's an icon representing "yes" ({% coinFlip id="yes" /%}), "no" ({% coinFlip id="no" /%}) or "unknown" ({% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}). There are 60 {% coinFlip id="yes" /%}, 60 {% coinFlip id="no" /%} and 40 {% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}.

The 4 first even suits have a {% coinFlip id="yes" /%}, the 4 first odd suits have a {% coinFlip id="no" /%}, and the rest of the cards have a {% coinFlip id="unknown" /%}. Notice that the suits that only have ranks 0-9 and not letters, have a {% coinFlip id="unknown" /%} always.

The icon has the color of the basic suit.

### Pyramidal rank

At the bottom of the bottom-right corner, there are a set of dots, those are the Pyramidal rank.

Point values are distributed equally across suits. Specifically, each suit has five 1's, four 2's, three 3's, two 4's, and one 5 (12345 ‚Ä¢ 54321). They can be used as an alternative rank value for games that require an uneven number of specific ranks, like Hanabi.

### Counting

![counting](/images/home/counting.png)

The back side of the cards also has utility, they serve as counters.

You can add a title to the counter by writing it in the area A of a card and putting it below. Don't overuse this technique or you'll run out of space, for example, if every player only has to count coins, don't put titles on the counters, it's assumed they are coins.

- **Stacking method**: Very clear, but multiple cards used.
  - Stack cards upright (worth 1) or upside-down (worth 5), the sum is the result.
- **Pointing method**: Only 2 cards used, but less clear.
  - Put 2 cards on top of each other, and align the arrow from the card in front to point a number in the card on the back, the pointed number is the result.
  - You can rotate the front card, and count negative or positive points.

## Card arrangements

When mapping new games, it's handy to visualize the cards in a layout that fits with the main sub-deck it uses.

The next images show simplified versions of the cards to focus better on the distribution. Notice that the 3 elements of the card get re-arranged based on the distribution, this way the element on the top is always the main one of that layout.

### Basic layout

## Other details

### Credits

The DIY multideck has been created by [Maurici Abad](https://mauriciabad.com), a young software engineer from Spain.

The deck was heavily inspired by [The Everdeck](https://thewrongtools.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/the-everdeck/), and it supports [almost all games for it](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/230703/games-playable-everdeck), plus [many more](/games).

### Design choices

- The rank is inside the suit to save up space. The downside is that it requires players to spread more the cards in hand to see the rank, but it's not uncomfortable.
- All suits are emojis, so you can easily write cheat sheets on your phone and send them to the other players.
- The colors of the suits can be grouped by similar hue in pairs but also trios.
- The slogan "Draw your cards" is there to encourage people to draw, and lose the fear of drawing in cards. It's fine! If you run out of space, you'll have amortized very well the cards, don't worry.
- The first 10 numbers of the sequential number corner start with 0 to make mantain the visual pattern of color in the number (left side black, right side colored)
- The check is filled and the cross hollow to increase the contrast between the two icons. And the question mark is also different by removing the enclosing circle.
- The voting icom and pyramidal rank are in the sequential number's corner to concentrate all the printed parts in the corners, so the rest of the space is perfectly symetrical and drawings can be drawn twice, upright and upside-down, to make cards work both orientations.
- Small digits in the 3D deck corner, start on 1 instead of on 0, for a more natural use of the cards, although then you cant just concatenate the digits to create numbers from 00 to 29.
- Small digits in the 3D deck corner are there for color-blind people, so they can know the color of the suit. And the number on the other side is also there to let players identify quicker the 3 components of the suit. The numbers are there also to add an order to the suits that may be used in some games, although it's preatty rare.
- The card backs use a lot of ink to increase the opacity of the card, specially on the corners, that's why the arrows are black.

### Inspiration

_In the future, we'll release a blog post about this topic._

A short spoiler: from The Everdeck and Rainbow deck mainly.

### Printing

The cards are designed to be to printed at home or basic copy shop.

The material used is polyester 300 grams, almost all copy shops have it (at least in Spain) and it offers great resistance and it's waterproof. The only downsides are that it is not environmentaly friendly and that it is not fully opaque.

For now the pdf document to print the cards is not public, but I may reconsider it and licence them with a Creative Commons license.

### Is it legal?

**Yes!** Selling/buying or printing the DIY Multideck is legal, even if the porpoise is to play other games. Also, this website, with explanations of how to play other games, and all it's contents, is legal.

Board games are generally not protected intellectual property. What is usually protected with copyright, are the assets they use, like: cards, tokens, boards or rulebooks. Some game mechanics may be patented, but it's very rare.

Explaining how to play a board game is legal, as long as you don't use copyrighted material without permission to do so.

About the trademarks; in this case, using other board games names and logos is fare use because it's "Informational use", also called "editorial use".

About the copyright; in this case, no assets from the game are used in the deck or this website.
