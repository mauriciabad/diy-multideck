        </h3><p>
          Even tough it may seem like by drawing you'll destroy your cards,
          they'll look very ugly and you'll have wasted them, the truth is the
          opposite: <strong
            >if you don't do draw on them, you're wasting the cards</strong
          >. Because they are meant to provide a solid base to play many games
          (the card corners) and use the remaining space to add the special
          cards that make each game unique.
        </p><p>
          I decided not to fill the cards with information, about my favorite
          games, and force you to adapt to my criteria. But instead, <strong
            >let you choose what games you want to have in your deck</strong
          >. This ensures all the information in the cards is used in some way,
          and makes them so much minimalistic and versatile.
        </p><p>
          In this website, there's a section with many game mapping
          instructions, hopefully you'll enjoy some of them. And if a game you
          want is not there, just think by yourself how to map it, and if you
          feel generous, submit a proposal.

          <img src="/images/home/random-numbers.svg" alt="random-numbers" />

          Each card has 12 random numbers. The random numbers are out of: <strong
            >3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30</strong
          >.
        </p><p>
          This can be used as dice throws. The deck includes the <strong
            >DND dice set</strong
          > in the cards (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20)
        </p><p>
          The random number, actually is the result of the modulus operation,
          from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic"
            >modular arithmetic</a
          >, between the card number (top right corner) and the total (bottom
          number in the fraction). This is to ensure all values are equally
          distributed.
        </p><p>
          In 2 cases, there are some random numbers that have slightly more
          chances of appearing than others. Because 7 and 9 are not factors of
          120, there are extra values.
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            For 7, there's an extra 7 in the deck. So obtaining a 7 is 0.83%
            more likely than a another number, negligible.
          </li><li>
            For 9, there's an extra 9, 1, and 2 in the deck. So obtaining a 9,
            1, or 2 is 0.83% more likely than a another number, negligible.
          </li>
        </ul><p>
          If, for some weird reason, you need absolute precision when drawing a
          random number out of 7, 9, or a total not in the cards, don't use this
          feature. Instead, select all the cards with the possible results you
          want in the card number (top right corner), shuffle and pick one.

          card and putting it below. Don't overuse this technique or you'll run
          out of space, for example, if every player only has to count coins,
          don't put titles on the counters, it's assumed they are points.

            The rank is inside the suit to save up space. The downside is that

            The bottom-left suits are composited by the 3 colors of the cards
            they appear in, this way they look different from the other
            one-colored suits, and at the same time don't look too different
            because the average color tone is close to the one of the card.
          </li><li>All suits are very distinct shapes.</li><li>
            The colors of the suits can be grouped by similar hue in pairs but
            also trios.

            4 of the suits are the ones from the French deck because this lets
            players use the cards as poker cards. The colors are also similar,
            black/ gray and red/orange, to keep consistency with the traditional
            deck but also to have different colors for modern games.

            The slogan "Draw your cards" is there to encourage people to draw,

          My main inspiration was The Everdeck, and the amazing forum thread in
          bgg that was used to get feedback and updates about the project. <em
            >I wish I've done the same, but I wanted to have something solid
            before showing it up to the world (And walla!, here it is!).</em
          >
        </p><p>
          What inspired me so much about The Ever deck was it's card
          distribution and mathematical approach to make everything fit evenly.
          The only thing that didn't convince me about The Everdeck was it's aim
          to have a "mystic" theme/utility. It's totally fine and awesome, but
          it didn't fulfill my specific need, that is: "play as many modern
          games as possible with a small deck".
        </p><p>
          My other motivation for this project, was that I was planning a
          sabbatical year bagpacking through the world, and I wanted to keep
          playing many board games, without having to carry them. So I did it as
          quick as possible, do I could have a printed beta version to take to
          the adventure, and when I come back from the trip, make some changes
          and release it to the public.

            The card's size is <strong>2.5 by 3.5 inches</strong>, the same as
            standard poker cards. You can fit 9 cards in a DIN A4 sheet, and 18
            cards in a DIN A3 sheet.
          </li><li>
            They are meant to be printed in <strong>100% plastic</strong> sheets
            of <strong>300 g/m²</strong> or more, so they are waterproof and extremely
            durable.<ul>
              <li>
                You could also use thick paper and/or laminate it, but they'd
                last less time, probably wouldn't shuffle satisfyingly, and
                possibly you couldn't either use pencils to draw on them.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Drawing in the cards:<ul>
              <li>
                Pens/markers ink sticks into it and it cannot be erased, even
                the special whiteboard markers.
              </li><li>
                <strong>Pencils</strong> work as usual, making them the <strong

            The cards can be printed in a regular copy shop or at home.

            It's very important to ensure all cards have the <strong

                The best way is by using an industrial guillotine, to cut all

                This is more important than the cards dimension, so don't worry
                if they don't measure exactly 2.5 x 3.5 inches.

                If you're at home, make sure the paper tray is well aligned

                If you go to a shop, ask them to pay special attention to this

            To round the <strong>corners</strong>, it's best buy a small tool to
            do so, and do it yourself <strong>manually</strong>. Many copy shops
            won't do it or may charge a lot.<ul>

                In Barcelona, Spain at Feb 2023, I managed to print a single
                deck for 26.2 € in a copy shop with great results. With 100%
                plastic (the most expensive sheet they sold) and without rounded
                corners.

        </h3><p>
          This are some main ideas I was trying to bring to the deck, but I had
          to give up on them for various reasons.
        </p><p>
          For all of them, I found a way to fix the issues, and it was letting
          the players draw the game-specific elements in the cards not being
          used as numbered cards. Yes, it feels bad to write on cards, but they
          are meant for that, and the space would be used anyway with another
          less convenient thing.
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            Words<ul>
              <li>
                What is it about? Adding 1 or many words to the cards to use as
                social games like Werewolf, Mafia, Avalon... Or for some other
                word games, like Cross clues.
              </li><li>
                Why discarded?<ul>
                  <li>
                    Because it would force players to only play the games I
                    chose, I prefer you write the specific words you need for
                    the games you like.
                  </li><li>
                    Also, with many words it would be confusing to know what is
                    the word in use.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li><li>
            Emojis in the cards<ul>
              <li>
                What is it about? Adding 1 or many emojis to the cards. To use
                as roles for social games, actions in specific games or any
                creative use players may come up with.
              </li><li>
                Why discarded?<ul>
                  <li>
                    Because it's actually the same as words, but more ambiguous.
                    Could be good for multiple game re-using and using less
                    space, but it could also could cause confusion up to a point
                    of making games unplayable. For example: a player sees 🧪 in
                    her card, she thinks she has the doctor, but she's actually
                    the witch and the doctor was: 💊.
                  </li><li>
                    A part from that, the uses of emojis where not clear and,
                    yes they look cool, but most of them wouldn't be used and
                    confuse noob players.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li><li>
            Index<ul>
              <li>
                What is it about? On the side of the cards, leave some light
                marks to let the owner of the deck draw a small line in the card
                edge, to indicate what cards belong to what games. And then, to
                setup a game he would just have to slightly displace the cards
                and pick the ones with the mark on the same position.
              </li><li>
                Why discarded?<ul>
                  <li>
                    Because it requires high precision in printing and cutting,
                    and it's unrealistic to do at home.
                  </li><li>
                    Also, the marks where so small and close, that it was too
                    easy to pick other game's cards by mistake. Also, added
                    clutter.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li><li>
            Generic action icons<ul>
              <li>
                What is it about? On the top-right corner, put a generic icon of
                something related to card games, like a crossed card or a
                shield, to be used to play games that have special cards, like
                the UNO.
              </li><li>
                Why discarded?<ul>
                  <li>
                    Because games use very specific icons, and is very difficult
                    to make a set of icons that work in many games.
                  </li><li>
                    Also, the killer factor is that, I realized that, when
                    playing a game with regular suits and special cards, it's
                    very easy to get confused and think that an icon card is
                    meant to be used as a number card and vice-versa, specially
                    in games with more than 4 suits. This makes the game
                    unplayable.
                  </li><li>
                    And another reason was that if the action icon you need, is
                    in a card that you need for the numbered cards, you're in
                    trouble, because you'll have to chose another less-ideal
                    icon and players will confuse the original card as the
                    action card and the less-ideal with the number card, messing
                    everything up.
                  </li>
                </ul>
